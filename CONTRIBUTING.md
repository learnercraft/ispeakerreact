## ðŸ”€ Submitting pull requests

### ðŸ“Œ Project note

- This project **does not use TypeScript** or any kind of static type checking yet.
  - In the meantime, **use `PropTypes`** to validate component props for basic type safety.

### âœ… What you should do

- **Use a code editor** (e.g., Visual Studio Code) to write and format code efficiently.

- **Format your code** before committing and pushing.

- **Test your code thoroughly** before pushing.

- **Use clear, concise variable names** written in `camelCase`. Names should be self-explanatory and reflect their purpose.

### ðŸš« What you should NOT do

- Submit pull requests that only include **cosmetic changes** like whitespace tweaks or code reformatting without functionality.  
  These changes clutter diffs and make code reviews harder. [See this comment by the Rails team](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700).

- Modify configuration files (e.g., `.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc`, etc.) without prior discussion.

- Add code that:
  - Is **obscure** or **unclear** in intent
  - Is **malicious** or **unsafe**
  - **Executes scripts from external sources**
