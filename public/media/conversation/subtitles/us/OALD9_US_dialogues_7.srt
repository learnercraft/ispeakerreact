1
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:12,719
Gotta go soon.

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,819
Picking Sarah up from the airport.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,869
I hate airports.

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,969
Trains are so much nicer, right?

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,719
That depends on the train. Sometimes

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,469
they're dirty and crowded, don't you think?

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,487
I guess so.

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,247
And what do you think about

9
00:00:26,248 --> 00:00:27,909
those new high-speed trains? 

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:28,531
Ah, they're great, 

11
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:29,775
but they're so expensive.
