00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,069
Excuse me, but can I just ask where

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,737
we're going to publicize this?

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,521
Well, that's something we probably need

4
00:00:12,522 --> 00:00:14,617
to look into before our next meeting.

5
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,359
Yes, Jo? I was wondering if

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,188
we have a launch date yet?

7
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,529
I'll actually come back to

8
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,271
that point later, when we deal 

9
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:22,659
with the project scheduling.
