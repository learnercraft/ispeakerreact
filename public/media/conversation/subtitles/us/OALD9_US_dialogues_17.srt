00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,879
Do you think you'll be in DC on the 15th?

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,314
Ah, I'm probably going to

3
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:12,749
be in Baltimore that day,

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,758
Will you be back by six?

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,189
I wouldn't bet on it -

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,881
There'll probably be a lot of

7
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:19,638
traffic on the way home.
