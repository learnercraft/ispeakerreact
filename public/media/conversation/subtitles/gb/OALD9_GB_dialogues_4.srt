00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,331
It says on the box, 'Take two tablets,

2
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:12,667
in the morning and in the evening.'

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,457
I'm not very clear about that.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,099
Do they mean to say for a day?

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,769
Sorry, I don't quite follow...

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,946
I mean is it two in the morning and 

7
00:00:22,947 --> 00:00:27,667
two in the evening? Ah, I see.

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,295
I'm not sure, to be honest.
