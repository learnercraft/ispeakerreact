00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,983
Excuse me, but can I just ask where

2
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:10,659
we're going to publicize this?

3
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,129
Well, that's something we probably 

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,345
should look into further. Yes, Jo?

5
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:18,178
I was wondering if we have a launch date yet.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,952
Can I come back to that point later,Â 

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,706
when we deal with the project scheduling?
