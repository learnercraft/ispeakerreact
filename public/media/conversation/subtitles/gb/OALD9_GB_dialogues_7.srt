1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,904
I've got to go soon.

2
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,276
I'm picking up Claire from the airport.

3
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,158
Oh, I hate airports.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,305
Traveling by train's

5
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:15,009
much nicer, isn't it? 

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,889
Depends on the train.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,634
Sometimes they're dirty and crowded, aren't they?

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,928
I guess so.

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,544
What do you think about

10
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:26,159
those new high-speed trains? 

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,071
They're great,

12
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:28,895
but they're terribly expensive.
