1
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,000
[LIU] Well, in my opinion, the best thing

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,599
about cycling is the exercise.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,103
You can go from A to B and

4
00:00:18,104 --> 00:00:21,237
keep fit at the same time.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,920
What do you think?

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,200
[VIKI] I agree.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,639
And it's quiet and clean.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,615
I mean, bikes don't create pollution

9
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:33,440
like cars, and they don't use oil.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,834
[LIU] Hmm, yes, bikes are
better for the environment.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,779
[VIKI] Yes, exactly. But on the other hand,

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,983
there are bad points too. I mean,

13
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:45,850
it can be quite dangerous, can't it?

14
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:49,336
[LIU] Yes, that's true. Especially in

15
00:00:49,337 --> 00:00:52,909
the city with all the traffic.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,013
An another bad point is the weather -

17
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,254
cycling isn't pleasant in

18
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:03,560
rainy and cold conditions.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,120
[VIKI] Uh, uh.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,069
No. And it can be really

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,548
tiring if you go up a hill.

22
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,040
I don't cycle because I live in the

23
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,536
mountains, and all the
roads are really steep.

24
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,824
If I lived in a flat place like Holland,

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,349
I might cycle more.

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,040
What about you? Do you cycle?

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,320
[LIU] Sometimes, but only on holidays,

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,800
not to go to work.

29
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,159
I think the people in the

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,329
photos are going to work.

31
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:42,480
[VIKI] So, which place do you think looks

32
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,800
more dangerous for the cyclists?

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:54,379
[LIU] Well, I would say it's
OK in the first picture,

34
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,671
because there is a special part

35
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:59,239
of the road for the cyclist,

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,785
but not in the second picture -

37
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,005
the cyclists are in the middle of the

38
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:10,123
traffic, and it looks quite dangerous.

39
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:13,590
[VIKI] Yes, and I think the man in the

40
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,368
first picture is better prepared.

41
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,249
He's wearing a bright colored coat

42
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,080
and - what do you call it?
A cycling hat?

43
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,760
[LIU] A helmet, you mean?

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,160
[VIKI] Helmet, exactly. The people in the

45
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,000
second picture haven't got helmets.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,869
[LIU] Hmm.

47
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,708
[VIKI] But there again,

48
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,360
it could be more dangerous

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,092
in the first picture,

50
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,885
because the traffic is going much faster,

51
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,520
isn't it?

52
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,399
[LIU] Hmm, yes, I suppose so.

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,049
But there is plenty of space.

54
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,809
Hmm, on the whole,
I think it's more dangerous

55
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,600
in the second picture.

56
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,419
[VIKI] Yeah.

57
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,620
Yeah, I think you're
probably right.
