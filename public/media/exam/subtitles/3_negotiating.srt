1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,927
OK, so we have to choose one picture

2
00:00:08,928 --> 00:00:11,854
to put on the front of the brochure.

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,009
Shall we get started, then?

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,579
Er, let's see...

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,318
It's really difficult.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,196
Personally, if I were choosing a holiday,

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,511
I think I would pick up a brochure with

8
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:35,208
a picture of the dancers on the front,

9
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,086
but that's because I enjoy folk dancing.

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,543
Maybe that would not be so

11
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:42,619
good for most people.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,799
No, possibly not. To be honest,

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,747
that one looks boring. 

14
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:51,563
If you ask me, we should choose one

15
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:54,359
which most people would find attractive.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,335
How about the photo of the food?

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,767
Everybody likes eating! 

18
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,619
That's true, but I don't think 

19
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,994
Scotland is famous for food.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,807
I think if people wanted a food holiday,

21
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,189
they would choose Italy or

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,569
France or somewhere like that.

23
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,309
OK, that's a good point.

24
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,395
It's the same with the picture of the beach -

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,355
it's beautiful, 

26
00:01:22,356 --> 00:01:25,701
but I've never heard of people going 

27
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:28,899
to Scotland for a beach holiday.

28
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,679
From what I've heard,

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,904
it's always raining in Britain.

30
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,247
Yes, that's right,

31
00:01:34,248 --> 00:01:37,369
everybody says that the weather's terrible there.

32
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,385
Well, ...we could use the picture 

33
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:44,069
of the mountain climbers.

34
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,723
It would give people the idea of

35
00:01:47,724 --> 00:01:51,067
things you can do in Scotland.

36
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,990
What that would be very popular? I doubt it.

37
00:01:55,991 --> 00:02:01,209
Maybe we should focus on history and culture.

38
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,687
What's happening in the first picture,

39
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:09,039
for example? I've no idea.

40
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,687
It looks like a carnival or something.

41
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,136
But I think I would opt for the castle. 

42
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,195
To me, that's a typical image of Scotland, 

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,663
and I can imagine it would look

44
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:25,559
great on the cover of the brochure.

45
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,095
What do you think?

46
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:29,969
Well, as far as I'm concerned,

47
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,345
the carnival or the castle would be fine. 

48
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,515
So, shall we use the castle then? 

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,507
Yes, OK. That's fine by me.

50
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,827
Right, so I think we're agreed.

51
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,726
We'll use the photo of the castle.
