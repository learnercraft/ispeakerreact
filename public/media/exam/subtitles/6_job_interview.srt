00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,395
Good morning, Mr Mason.

2
00:00:08,396 --> 00:00:10,699
Take a seat, please. Thank you. 

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,706
Now, I can see from your CV 

4
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:16,317
that you graduated from Bristol

5
00:00:16,318 --> 00:00:18,423
University just over a year ago.

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,290
Yes, that's right.

7
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,711
So, can you tell me a little bit 

8
00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:24,112
about what you've been doing since then?

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,191
Yes, first of all,

10
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,944
I got a summer job as a group leader

11
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:30,436
at a children's summer camp in Canada.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,699
That's something that I'd

13
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,959
previously done in France, 

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,067
and I've always enjoyed working with kids.

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,381
When that was over,

16
00:00:37,382 --> 00:00:39,733
I came back to London and got

17
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:41,875
a job as a studio assistant in

18
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:44,099
a local community TV station.

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,049
What were your duties there?

20
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,257
Well, basically I did everything, you know,

21
00:00:48,258 --> 00:00:50,611
from taking calls to responding 

22
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:53,047
to emails and maintaining the website,

23
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,709
right the way through to interviewing and

24
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,488
helping out with the filming and editing.

25
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,721
It's a small company so I got a 

26
00:01:01,722 --> 00:01:05,466
chance to try a little bit of everything.

27
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,109
What did you enjoy most?

28
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:11,182
I guess the interviewing. I think I'm 

29
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:13,909
quite outgoing, so I love meeting 

30
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,561
people and finding out about them.

31
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,665
I see, right. So what about the future? 

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:25,655
Where do you see yourself in five years' time? 

33
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,268
I'd like to work for a larger TV network,

34
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,274
perhaps as an interviewer for

35
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:32,477
a regular programme, 

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,494
either interviewing guests in the

37
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,063
studio or going out and about,

38
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:39,478
interviewing members of the public.

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,838
And what made you decide to apply

40
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,559
for a job with us?

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,079
I think this is a well-known company 

42
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,317
that's got a very good reputation,

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,425
so I felt it would be the ideal place

44
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,836
to develop my skills, and hopefully 

45
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:54,524
contribute something with my 

46
00:01:54,525 --> 00:01:56,479
enthusiasm and willingness to learn.

47
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,199
OK, well, thank you for coming in today.

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,013
Obviously, we have a few more candidates 

49
00:02:02,014 --> 00:02:04,854
to consider, so we will be making a 

50
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:07,365
selection in a week or so, and we'll

51
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:10,184
let you know one way or the other.

52
00:02:10,185 --> 00:02:10,969
OK, thanks.
