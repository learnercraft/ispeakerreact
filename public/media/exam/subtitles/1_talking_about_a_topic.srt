00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,368
[EXAMINER] Please describe a place
that you sometimes visit

2
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:12,167
which is very important to you.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,871
You should say where it is, and

4
00:00:14,872 --> 00:00:17,617
how often and why you go there.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,489
[WOMAN]
One place that is very important in

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,867
my life is my grandmother's house.

7
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,927
She lives in a small village

8
00:00:25,928 --> 00:00:28,318
in the south of the country.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,973
I go there every summer, and any time

10
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:36,378
when I can get away for a few days.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,879
I go there to visit my grandmother,

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,023
get away from the city and relax.

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,263
The village is just a group of

14
00:00:47,264 --> 00:00:49,859
white houses on a hillside

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,009
and a couple of shops,

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,849
and it's really peaceful.

17
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,574
There's no traffic,

18
00:00:57,575 --> 00:01:01,024
just the sound of goat bells,

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,578
birds and insects.

20
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,841
One reason why I like it is

21
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:11,129
because it's a beautiful place.

22
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,149
My grandmother has a lovely garden

23
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,873
and we always sit outside in

24
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:21,009
the shade of her olive trees,

25
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,219
drinking sweet tea and chatting.

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,847
It's so peaceful.

27
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,960
But the main reason why this place is so

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,716
important to me is
because of my grandmother.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,429
She is so kind to me, and

30
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,529
wonderful to talk to.

31
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,369
Whenever I have a problem in my life,

32
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,137
she has good advice for me.

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,767
Also, she is a great cook

34
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:52,159
and the meals she prepares are

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,609
simple but so fresh and...

36
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,697
rich? Er no, er...

37
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:02,839
no, I mean tasty.

38
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,579
And she's always giving me eh...

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,319
What do you call them?

40
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,596
- small plates of food during the day,

41
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,360
so I always return home feeling

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,319
calm and refreshed - and fat!

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,229
I wouldn't like to live there, though.

44
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,449
I prefer living in the city,

45
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:30,879
definitely. I'm a city person.

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,023
I couldn't live in a small

47
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:36,119
village where everybody knows

48
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:39,116
each other and nothing happens.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,357
I'd rather live in a busy,

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,585
exciting place.

51
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,600
But I really love visiting

52
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,960
the village for the holidays.
