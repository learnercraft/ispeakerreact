00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,131
Please describe this photograph.

2
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,519
What do you think is happening

3
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:12,737
and what is your opinion about it?

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,639
This picture shows two young men

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,589
chatting on a park bench. 

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,575
They are wearing casual clothes

7
00:00:21,576 --> 00:00:24,223
and training shoes. 

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,959
One of them has glasses.

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,959
It is a cloudy day.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,144
In the background,

11
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:33,514
we can see trees and grass.

12
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,809
There are a lot of red and orange

13
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,549
leaves on the ground, 

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:43,799
so I would say it's autumn in a cold country,

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,067
perhaps in the north of Europe, 

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,659
or maybe in North America.

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,431
There is a pram to the left of the bench

18
00:00:52,432 --> 00:00:55,048
and another one to the right. 

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,262
I would guess that they're babies in the prams,

20
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,575
although we can't actually see them. 

21
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,689
And I suppose that the

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,799
young men are the fathers.

23
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,859
The picture is slightly unusual,

24
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,265
because we normally expect to see 

25
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:12,869
mothers looking after babies.

26
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,627
In most parts of the world,

27
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,399
childcare is traditionally the mother's job.

28
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,819
But I think the idea for this photo is good,

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,479
and because in my opinion, 

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,704
both parents should have equal

31
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:27,484
responsibility for the children.

32
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,665
The picture

33
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:32,781
also makes us think about another question. 

34
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,218
It is the middle of the day.

35
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,835
Why aren't the men at work? 

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,503
It could be the weekend, of course, 

37
00:01:40,504 --> 00:01:43,663
or perhaps a public holiday.

38
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,039
But there is another possibility.

39
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,373
Perhaps the men look after their

40
00:01:49,374 --> 00:01:51,317
homes and the children full time, 

41
00:01:51,318 --> 00:01:53,529
and their wives go to work. 

42
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,819
We normally talk about housewives, 

43
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,418
but in this case maybe they are house husbands. 

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,079
I know this is unusual,

45
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,249
but why not?

46
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,809
I love that idea.
