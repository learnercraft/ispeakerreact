00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,213
Hello, I'm Martin.

2
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:10,365
What's your name please?

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,549
I'm Cristina. And where are you

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,055
from, Cristina? I'm from Spain. 

5
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:19,119
Oh, really? Whereabouts in Spain?

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,809
From a town called Iznalloz. 

7
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:25,485
It's near the city of Granada.

8
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,191
Oh right. And can you tell me a 

9
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:30,417
little bit about what you do?

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,855
Yes, I am a student. I am

11
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:39,407
studying economics at university. 

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,355
I also have a part-time 

13
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:44,319
job in a hairdresser's. 

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,909
And where do you live?

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,077
Actually, I live in two places.

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,963
During the week, when there are classes,

17
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,336
I live with an aunt in Granada,

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,907
near to the university,

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,373
and at the weekends I usually go home 

20
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:06,166
to my parents' place in Iznalloz. 

21
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,967
But next year I hope to rent a flat

22
00:01:09,968 --> 00:01:12,598
together with a friend of mine.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,666
OK. And how long have you been 

24
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,898
studying English. Oh for a long time.

25
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,819
I have been studying English

26
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,155
at school since primary,

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,834
and I have also done evening classes

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,167
at a language school. 

29
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,189
Nowadays, I try to practise by 

30
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,739
making friends on social media

31
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,871
and chatting in English. 

32
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:44,069
How important do you think English

33
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:48,469
will be in your career? Very important.

34
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:52,039
When I graduate, I hope to apply for a job

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,527
in a multinational company. 

36
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,799
I want to work abroad, 

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,629
in Britain or maybe another country,

38
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,109
you know. 

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:10,285
I would really love to see new places,

40
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,049
meet new people, see the world. 

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,919
I've never been outside Spain before,

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,497
it's too expensive,

43
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:21,653
But I've always wanted to travel.
