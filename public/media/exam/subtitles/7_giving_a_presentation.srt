1
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,190
So I'm here today to present you

2
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:10,347
with the results of that survey.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,415
Now to do this, I've divided my 

4
00:00:13,416 --> 00:00:15,279
presentation into three parts.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,264
Firstly, I'll talk about the

6
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:18,852
background to the research,

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,091
then we'll look at how we 

8
00:00:21,092 --> 00:00:23,239
approach the research and thirdly

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,224
I'll summarize the key findings

10
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,415
of the research.

11
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,749
So let's start with a brief

12
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,969
description of the background.

13
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,147
So once we selected the 90,000 customers

14
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:37,618
across your company's three regions,

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,997
we then emailed them the survey.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,519
We allowed four weeks for them to

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,209
respond to the surveys and after that

18
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,171
period we received a 4% response rate.

19
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:52,297
Now this is quite good for

20
00:00:52,298 --> 00:00:54,468
this type of survey.

21
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,103
We then analyzed those responses and

22
00:00:57,104 --> 00:01:00,138
compiled them in a report for you.

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,854
Let's look at those responses

24
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:03,569
in a bit more detail.

25
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,273
Now, of that 4%, this blue section

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,909
shows that 57% of those

27
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,539
responses came from the region

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,234
with the difficulties. That's significant,

29
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:20,177
as you are more likely to receive

30
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:23,627
responses from customers who are either

31
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:26,639
very satisfied or very unsatisfied.

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:26,947
Anyway,

33
00:01:26,948 --> 00:01:29,411
this leads me on to the third and

34
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:31,398
main part of my presentation:

35
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,107
the actual results of the survey. 

36
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,839
Now in front of you,

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,247
there's a copy of the survey's findings.

38
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,919
I'm going to summarize the key

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,789
findings for each of these questions.

40
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,387
So let's begin with question one,

41
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,532
which asks your customers how likely they

42
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:58,897
are to recommend your company to a friend.

43
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,724
As you can see, we have used a scale,

44
00:02:02,725 --> 00:02:06,246
with zero being not at all likely 

45
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:09,069
and ten being extremely likely. 

46
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:11,861
According to this chart,

47
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:14,653
the overall response indicates

48
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:17,947
that customers are fairly likely

49
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,937
to recommend your company. 

50
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,159
However, this chart represents an average

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,019
response across the three regions.

52
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,439
If we break these responses down

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,225
into the three regions like this,

54
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,459
it illustrates the difference in 

55
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,689
customer satisfaction region by region.

56
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:45,913
Now remember, red and yellow are the regions

57
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:48,908
with increasing numbers of customers.

58
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,809
Consequently, the responses are quite high,

59
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,609
even as high as ten,

60
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,967
but the lower scores in the 

61
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:01,429
previous chart were caused by the

62
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,459
decline in these blue responses here. 

63
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,745
They go down to the 

64
00:03:05,746 --> 00:03:07,889
zero level in some cases.
